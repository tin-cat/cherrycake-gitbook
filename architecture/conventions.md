# Conventions

Cherrycake uses the [JavaScript conventions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp) for entity naming, file naming and code structure. Of course, you can use your favorite conventions in your Cherrycake app.

### Entities

* **camelCase** for variables and methods. For example:
* **PascalCase** for types and classes. For example:
* **UPPER\_CASE\_SNAKE\_CASE** for constants. For example:

### File naming

Class names, module names and directories should follow the same **PascalCase** convention, take a look at the [Files structure](app-files-structure.md) section for more information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that class auto-loading might not work properly if you don't follow this naming conventions.
{% endhint %}

### Code structure

Feel free to use the structure methodology you prefer in your code. Cherrycake's own choice is tabs instead of spaces and a somewhat typical multi-line approach to function declarations and overall tidiness.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're contributing to the Cherrycake Engine, please always follow this official conventions.
