# Items

Items are Cherrycake's conceptualization of the fundamental objects stored in a database. For example, in an e-commerce site, a product would be an Item, but also would a user, a product category or an invoice.

The most interesting benefits of working with Items in Cherrycake are:

* Items can be easily retrieved, updated or deleted from the database, there's no need to implement your own database access code.
* All security-sensible operations with Items are supervised by the Cherrycake [Security](security.md) mechanisms.
* Items get all the [performance](performance.md) and caching benefits of Cherrycake right out of the box.
* Items support multi language fields, multi-timezone date-time fields, automatic URL slug generation and much more.
