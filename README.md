  Cherrycake is a low-level programming framework for developing modular,
  efficient and secure PHP server web applications.

# Introduction

Instead of a comprehensive, all-in-one web app building environment, Cherrycake aims only to provide a strong foundational layer and implementation methodology for your server web applications that feels comfortable, rational and easy to use while prioritizing Cherrycake's three main goals:

### Modularity



### Performance

### Security

## Applications

Because Cherrycake sits and stays at the very lower level of the server application, it provides you with a clean slate to build probably anything you can think of that is based on the HTTP protocol. That includes \(obviously\) any kind of website, but also: API endpoints, client-server architectures, proxy-like architectures, resource serving services or system interfacing servers, for example.

Because of this architecture, Cherrycake will come in handy if you want to build a regular website of any complexity, but also might be a great partner for your client-side application by letting you build the API it needs, if you're experimenting with new ways of using the Internet, or even as a strong foundation if you're developing your own server application programming framework.

## How it works

At its simplest, Cherrycake can be understood as an HTTP request router.
