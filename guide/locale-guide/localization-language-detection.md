# Localization language detection

[Google doesn't recommend](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182192) performing an automatic redirection to the user's perceived language, and [Locale](../../reference/core-modules/locale/) doesn't implement such a mechanism for that reason.

Instead, you might want to show the user the option to switch to another language/localization, specially if you've detected that it's different than the one he is currently visiting.
