# Cached queries

Cached queries allow you to dramatically improve performance in certain situations by preventing the database server from repeatedly performing the same query, storing the results in cache instead.

To perform a basic query with cache, use the [DatabaseProvider::queryCache](../../reference/core-classes/databaseprovider/databaseprovider-methods.md#querycache) method, this is how it would look:

```php
$result = $e->Database->main->queryCache(
    "select * from users order by rand()",
    \Cherrycake\CACHE_TTL_1_MINUTE
);
```

When iterating over the results like we did in the [Basic queries](basic-queries.md) section, you would get something like this:

```php
Douglas Engelbart
John Horton Conway
Frank Abagnale
Carl Sagan
Richard Feynmann
```

Note here that, even though the results have been randomly ordered thanks to the  `by rand()` clause in the SQL statement, we get the results in the same order if we execute the query multiple times. This is because the results were stored in the cache, and the query is not actually running, we're just getting the same results the cache system got in the first run.

> Because the cached results will expire after 1 minute because we set the TTL to `CACHE_TTL_1_MINUTE`, the result order will change if we execute the query when a minute has passed from the first execution.

## Cache key naming

Each object stored in cache has its own unique identifier key. When you run a cached query without specifying any cacheKeyNamingOptions parameter like we did above, the cache key is automatically generated by creating a unique hash from the SQL statement itself.

For example, when executing the cached query in the example above:`select * from users order by rand()`, a unique key was generated automatically that looked like this:

```php
CherrycakeApp_Database_64df95723d106ba80b0cf725bc56ddd1
```

This means that you can trust a different cache key will be generated for each different query you perform.
