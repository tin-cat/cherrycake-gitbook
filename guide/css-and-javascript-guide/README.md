# Css and Javascript guide

The [Css](../../reference/core-modules/css.md) and [Javascript](../../reference/core-modules/javascript.md) core modules allow you to easily work with CSS and JavaScript files in your web page project with some neat additional features:

* CSS and JavaScript files are parsed as [patterns](../../architecture/patterns/).
* Automatic minimization and single-request serving of multiple files.
* Cached CSS and JavaScript.
* Modules inject the CSS and JavaScript code they need.
* CSS and JavaScript dependencies via modules.
* Works in conjunction with HtmlDocument to automatically link the needed CSS/JavaScript resources.
