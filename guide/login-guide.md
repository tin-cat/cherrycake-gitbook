# Login guide

Using the [Login](../reference/core-modules/login.md) module, you're able to start implementing a secure password-based user authentication mechanism to your app.

Instead of implementing a complete user authentication workflow, the [Login](../reference/core-modules/login.md) module provides you a standardized method that you can adopt to create your authentication workflow, where things like the login form, the user database structure or the logout button are still up to you to implement to your liking.
