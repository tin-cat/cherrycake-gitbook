# Janitor guide

In many cases you'll need some sort of mechanism to automatically execute tasks with certain periodicity, at certain times of the day, or every few days. This tasks are usually maintenance tasks, batch processes, database purges, cache flushes, buffer commits, etcetera. The [Janitor](../reference/core-modules/janitor/) module is designed to do exactly that.
