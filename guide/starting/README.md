  We'll create a simple Cherrycake application from the ground up, the best way
  to learn.

# Starting

I recommend you to first check the Vanilla setup, which will guide you to setup a Cherrycake application from zero, the best way to really understand how Cherrycake works:

{% page-ref page="vanilla.md" %}

Once you got it, you can always use the Cherrycake Skeleton, which sets you up with a boilerplate Cherrycake application straightaway:

{% page-ref page="with-skeleton.md" %}

There's also a docker setup that will get you a running development server with everything you need to start building a Cherrycake application in just a few minutes:

{% page-ref page="with-docker.md" %}
