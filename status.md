Although Cherrycake is still under heavy development and it's still in a beta stage, it's functional and it's already running some public web applications without issues. It's still not recommended to use Cherrycake in critical, or data sensitive applications.

Instead, you're encouraged to try it to see for yourself whether it meets your security and stability requisites, and to contribute your suggestions or improvements via the official git repositories.

You might find Cherrycake to perfectly match your needs for your upcoming project, or it might simply become a fun way to contribute and experiment with a newly born engine.
